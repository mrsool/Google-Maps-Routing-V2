# Ruby Client for the Google Maps Routing V2 API

API Client library for the Google Maps Routing V2 API

This library is built using the official protocol buffers in [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) repository.

The client code is generated using the [gapic-generator-ruby](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-ruby) gem.
## Installation

```
$ gem install google-maps-routing-v2
```

## Quick Start Example

```ruby
require "google/maps/routing/v2"

client = ::Google::Maps::Routing::V2::Routes::Client.new
request = ::Google::Maps::Routing::V2::ComputeRoutesRequest.new # (request fields as keyword arguments...)
response = client.compute_routes request
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.6+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Older versions of Ruby _may_
still work, but are unsupported and not recommended. See
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details about the Ruby
support schedule.
